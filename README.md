# Auto Tester a program which facilitates rote learning. It allows to create own databases and then allows to test yourself from the knowledge of those databases. It is ideally suited to study about new foreign vocabulary, irregular verbs, historical events, product codes and many, many more.
The program implements the modern methods of learning such as: programmed learning and flashcards.

Keep in mind that during tests your answers have to be identical to those saved in the base.

During adding or editing a row in your base, you can use the Enter button.

What is a threshold / learning progress? After nth correct answer on the test, the program will no longer choose that row in the following tests. The program will assume that you have learnt it and there is no reason to ask you about it again.
