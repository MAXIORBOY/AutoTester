# Auto Tester is a program which facilitates rote learning. It allows to create own databases and then allows to test yourself from the knowledge of those databases. It is ideally suited to study about new foreign vocabulary, irregular verbs, historical events, product codes and many, many more. The program implements modern methods of learning such as: programmed learning and flashcards.

## Features:
* Create your own databases via the creator or import them from a different file. 
* Add (or edit) new data into your databases fast! You can fill and accept all entries without a mouse usage. During adding or editing a row in your database, you can use the Enter button. 
* Test yourself! You have to fill (according to your database) the rest of the fields while having only one clue from one column. You can choose a number of questions and which column will be given at a test (random, first or last). Order of the rows will be randomized. Keep in mind that during tests your answers have to be identical to those saved in the database.
* You can change any option (except of a number of columns in a database) via settings.

## FAQ:
